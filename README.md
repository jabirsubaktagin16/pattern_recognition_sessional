Here I implemented our Pattern Recognition Sessional Assignments. Implemented Algorithms are given below:


1. Designing Minimum Distance to Class Mean Classifier

2. Implementing the Perceptron algorithm for finding the weights of a Linear Discriminant function

3. Implementing Minimum Error Rate Classifier

4. Implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

5. Implementing K-Means Clustering
